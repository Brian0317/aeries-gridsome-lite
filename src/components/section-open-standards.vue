        | Unlike competitors, Aeries doesn’t force you into a bloated bundle of loosely-integrated proprietary services and call it an “all in one solution” - instead, we offer tight interoperability with the tools you already use, so you can bring your own best-of-breed or choose to use drop-in Aeries solutions.
