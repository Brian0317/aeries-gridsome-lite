              <p class="mt-4">Devin wears many hats as both a teacher and a comedian.  Perhaps you've seen his videos online; he's known for his original humor that appeals to students, teachers, and parents alike. (Did we mention he's had more than 200 million views on his videos alone?)</p>
              <p class="mt-4">His accolades include being named 2015 iHeartMedia Monsters in the Morning Comedian of the Year, a winner of the Boston World Series of Comedy, a semi-finalist in Florida's Funniest Comedian, and many more.</p>`,
